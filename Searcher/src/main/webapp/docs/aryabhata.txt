The Aryabhatiya presents a method to solve linear indeterminate equations, which may 
be adapted to find the multiplicative inverse in a group that is of interest in cryptography, 
signal processing, coding and computer design. Although Aryabhata calls this method the
Kuttaka (the pulverizer), it is now better known as the Aryabhata Algorithm

Aryabhata algorithm is an algorithm to solve indeterminate Diophantine equations and for residue arithmetic. In particular, it is an algorithm to determine the smallest positive number which satisfies a list of congruences. It is first described in the mathematician-astronomer Aryabhata's book Aryabhatiya (499). In recent years, it has been used for cryptographic applications.
