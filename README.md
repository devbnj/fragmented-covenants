Fragmented Covenants is structured around mainstays of technology exploring into documents of yesteryears and unearthing new relationships from Vedic and Biblical texts. Extending into Internet-of-Things, Fragmented Covenants delves into an atypical facet - reinforcing a new relationship between man and divine. We just cannot be connected with the Lord in abstractness, but in a practical aspect - in relationship to what we experience on this planet. Looking back, our conception of the Lord has always been a cognizable portion of his pure abstraction - ‘the absolute’ in a form of a relative being.  When the knots in the mind cannot be disentangled by reading, listening or logic; Fragmented Covenants lets you delve into the Lords sayings from a different dimension.
